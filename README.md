# Docker in Production using AWS - Wheel

This project provides a Docker image that builds Python wheels.

These wheels can then be installed without compilation and associated development library dependencies in other Alpine-based Docker images, keeping these images to a minimum.

## Quick Start

See the [dockerproductionaws/ansible](http://github.com/docker-production-aws/ansible) repository for an example of how to use this image.
